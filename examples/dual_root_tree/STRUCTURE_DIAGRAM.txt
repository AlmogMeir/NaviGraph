Dual-Rooted Binary Tree Structure Diagram
==========================================

Example: Symmetric tree with height 3 on each side


        L0 ←→ R0          (Level 0: Roots connected)
        /  \  /  \
      L10  L11 R10 R11     (Level 1: 4 nodes total)
      / \  / \ / \ / \
    L20 L21 L22 L23 R20 R21 R22 R23  (Level 2: 8 nodes total)


Key Properties:
--------------
- Root Connection: L0 ←→ R0 (bidirectional edge)
- Left Tree: L0 → L10, L11 → L20, L21, L22, L23
- Right Tree: R0 → R10, R11 → R20, R21, R22, R23
- Total Nodes: 14 (2 roots + 6 left + 6 right)
- Total Edges: 13


Example: Asymmetric tree (height 4 left, height 2 right)


               L0 ←→ R0          (Level 0: Roots)
              /  \  /  \
           L10   L11  R10 R11    (Level 1)
           / \   / \
         L20 L21 L22 L23         (Level 2: Left only)
         /\ /\ /\ /\
        ... (8 nodes)             (Level 3: Left only)


Key Properties:
--------------
- Asymmetric depth
- Left tree has 14 nodes (1+2+4+8-1)
- Right tree has 1 node
- Total: 17 nodes, 16 edges
- Useful for biased/unbalanced exploration studies


Node Naming Convention:
----------------------
Format: [Tree][Level][Position]

Tree:
  L = Left tree
  R = Right tree

Level:
  0 = Root
  1 = First level below root
  2 = Second level below root
  ...

Position:
  Position within that level (0-indexed)

Examples:
  L0   = Left root
  R0   = Right root
  L10  = Left tree, level 1, position 0 (leftmost)
  L11  = Left tree, level 1, position 1 (rightmost)
  R22  = Right tree, level 2, position 2


Use Cases:
----------
1. T-Maze with branches:
   - Start at one root
   - Make choice to enter left or right tree
   - Explore branches within chosen side

2. Choice paradigm:
   - Each tree represents a choice option
   - Depth represents commitment to choice
   - Root crossing = changing decision

3. Bidirectional navigation:
   - Animal can freely move between trees
   - Track preference and exploration depth
   - Measure switching behavior

4. Learning paradigm:
   - Reward in one tree
   - Track how depth of exploration changes
   - Measure learning through tree preference


Configuration Examples:
----------------------

Symmetric (balanced):
graph:
  builder:
    type: dual_root_binary_tree
    params:
      left_height: 3
      right_height: 3

Asymmetric (biased):
graph:
  builder:
    type: dual_root_binary_tree
    params:
      left_height: 4  # Deeper left side
      right_height: 2  # Shallower right side

Minimal (just roots):
graph:
  builder:
    type: dual_root_binary_tree
    params:
      left_height: 1
      right_height: 1
